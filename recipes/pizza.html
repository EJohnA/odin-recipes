        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Water</li>
            <li>1/2 (12 Ounces) Tomato Paste - This recipe recomends Contadina brand paste but anything will work. Consider ingredients already in your store-bough paste, and adjust added ingredients accordingly.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dried, Crushed Oregano.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dried, Crushed Basil.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder.</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon Sugar.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt.</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Crust:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/4 cups All Purpose Flour.</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes of Pizza Yeast, or Rapid Rise yeast - This recipe recommends Fleischmanns.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sugar.</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Salt.</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups <em>very</em> warm Water - 120F - 130F.</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese.</li>
            <li>6 ounces Pepperoni.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven and Prepare Pans - Preheat to 425 Degrees F and apply a film of oil to two 12 inch pizza pans.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Sauce - Whisk together Water, Tomato Paste, Oregano, Basil, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Sugar, Salt and Pepper in a medium bown until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the Crust - Combine 2 cups Flour, Yeast, Sugar and Salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil. Mix until well blended (should take about 1 minute). Gradually add remaining Flour until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer Dough to a Floured surface - Knead until smooth and elastic (should take about 4 minutes). Add more flour as needed. <em>If using Rapid Rise Yeast, let Dough rest covered for 10 minutes.</em></li>
            <li>Divide Dough in half. Apply a light amount of flower to your hands, and gently pat each piece of Dough onto your pans, forming the shape as you go.</li>
            <li>Top the Dough with Sauce, Cheese and Pepperoni.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated over until Crusts are browned and Cheese is bubbly. Expect 18-30 minutes cook time. Rotate pans between top and bottom racks halfway through.</li>
        </ol>
